      type: string
      description: The type of the login restriction rule. The type could be either `ALLOW` and defines a condition (IP and/or expression) to allow login or could be `DENY` and defines a condition (IP and/or expression) to deny login. The rules of the same type are always evaluated as one set of rules - the order is not significant. But the order of evaluation 'AllOW' and 'DENY' sets, depend on the type of the policy they belong to.
    clientAddress:
      type: string
      description: "The client address for the login restriction rule. When the\
        \ current rule is evaluated it is compared with this client address. If\
        \ there is no match then the rule is assumed to not match. If the current\
        \ client address matches to the one defined in the rule and any additional\
        \ conditions defined in the rule(for example expressions) also match (all\
        \ of them) then the rule is assumed to match to the current user connection\
        \ and is applied. \n\nThe value of the client address could be one of:\n\
        \  - Specific IPv4 address\n  - Specific IPv6 address\n  - Specific IPv4\
        \ address combined with a network mask. Example: 172.23.34.0/24\n  - Specific\
        \ IPv6 address combined with a network mask. Example: FC00:1234:56::/120\n\

        \ Specific fully qualified host name, which is allowed to contain the\
        \ * wildcard character. Example: *.domain.com\n"
    expression:
      type: string
      description: The expression that should be evaluated to true in order for the rule to apply. This expression should be in the form of the SecureTransport expression language. It may include any environment variables, session attributes or other elements which are available at login time. For example it may include expression which evaluates the user class of the current user and compares it with some value. This expression may be not set - empty string or null value, in which case it would not be taken into account (cosider it true).
